## Done by Fedorov Alexey

# Task 1. Get familiar with Docker Engine

## 1. Pull Nginx v1.23.3 image from dockerhub registry and confirm it is listed in local images

To pull image, i used command `docker pull`.

To list images, i used command `docker images (docker image ls)`.

Image pulled correctly.

## 2. Run the pulled Nginx as a container with the below properties

a. Map the port to 8080.
b. Name the container as nginx-<stX>.
c. Run it as daemon .

To follow the lists of requirements, I will use the following flags:

- `-p` - sets port mapping
- `-n` - sets container name
- `-d` - runs container in background (as a daemon)

Command is:

`docker run -p 80:8080 --name nginx-fedorov-alexey -d nginx:1.23.3`

Container started successfully.

## 3. Confirm port mapping

### a. List open ports in host machine.

I used `ss` command to list ports

Port is present on host machine.

### b. List open ports inside the running container.

To list ports inside container, I need to install `netstat` or `ss` inside container. Lets do it.

I attached to container shell using exec with interactive mode.

Installed iproute2 package, that contains `ss` utility.

Now we can see that port allocated.

### c. Access the page from your browser.

Going to `127.0.0.1:8080` in my browser.

Everything works correct.

## 4. Create a Dockerfile similar to the below properties (letâ€™s call it container A).
